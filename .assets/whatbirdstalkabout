Hey yo. How's it going.
Hi hi, what's up.
Ey, how you doing.

Oh sweet, are you knitting? I love a good stitch.
Is that some yarn you're working with there? Knitting is my jam.
So you're knitting huh? Cool hobby. Much respect here.

Do you think you'd like to make one for me, dude?
Hey well I'm naked here dude, would you help out?
Tell you what, I could use some clothing. What do you say?

 +Alright, cool. Here's what I'm thinking.
 
 -Hey, no problem. You got your business I got mine. See you around.
 -So be it. Maybe next time, eh?
 -Well alright then. No hard feelings. I'll see you later, yeah?

I'd love to have a lavender beanie. They just speak to me, you know?
I'd kill for a burgundy scarf. Someone's gotta set the trends, right?
I could use a teal sweater. Really feeling the teal lately.

 +Cool. Eager to see this thing.
 +Cool. I won't judge your knitting, just take your time.
 +Cool. Easy does it, yeah?
 
You know, I've been looking into weights lately. Nothing's standing out.
	There's maybe one thing I'd go for, and it's the raw barbells.
	To be honest though, I'm totally new to all of this.
	I don't even know what I can handle. Maybe 10 pounds.
	I bet you lift. Seriously, you are ripped. Got any tips?
	Hey I understand if you don't want anyone stealing your routine though.
I don't get art. You know? It's so complicated.
	Seems like half the time, the artist wants a clean portrait.
	The other half, it's all about the process and the reasoning behind it.
	I can't follow it. I'm not asking for an artist statement, but...
	I just don't want to feel like I'm viewing something "wrongly."
	I don't know. Nevermind. I don't want to bore you with that.
You ever gone backpacking in the wilderness? It's powerful.
	It makes you feel strong, to handle yourself outside for a night.
	It's like shutting nature down, right there.
	You don't get that out here. All you get is jobs and salaries.
	Man. If I could, I'd live out there. I'd build my own life.
	You can respect a guy like Thoreau. He knew what was up, you know?
